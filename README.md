# Thaumic Boots
Thaumic Boots is an addon for thaumcraft 4
   
This mod will be almost entirely focused on adding new boots and combinations of already existing boots Thaumcraft

I'd also like to take this line to extend my thanks to the Arcana team for their lovely textures.
Thank you to the artists Ibanplay and I-Luna, from whom many of the original assets for this mod were taken.
